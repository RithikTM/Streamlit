        "prompt": "I am a Software Tester I am planning to write test scenarios for the below user story. Please suggest me what needs to be considered as 'Assumptions' Test Scenario Assumptions should be specific to the user story Only those that are amenable to a different interpretation should be taken and the tester should be given a decisive guess. Dont need to list assumptions pertaining to non functional testing aspects like security, performance etc. The Electric Vehicle (EV) Application is a web-based platform designed for residents of Colorado to apply for a voucher program. Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM serves as the central application in this project, where any configurations made within reflect directly in the portal. The portal allows applicants to access and apply for various programs, while retailers redeem the E-Bike vouchers, and dealers redeem the VXC. Upon submitting a dealer response, a new voucher is generated for the dealer. CRM users are responsible for reviewing, approving, or rejecting applications, as well as approving payments and completing the process. They also configure programs, ensuring that all relevant information is displayed accurately on the portal. Applicant: The person who applies for the program through the portal. They submit their application for review. Retailer: Also referred to as a seller, they redeem E-bike vouchers. Once an applicant is approved and issued a voucher, they can use it to purchase an E-bike from a participating retailer. Dealer: They redeem VXC (Vehicle Exchange) vouchers. When an applicant is approved for a VXC voucher, they can exchange it for a vehicle at a participating dealer. Admin: Has access to the CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system. They configure the program settings in the CRM, including voucher types, eligibility criteria, and application review processes. Portal User: Refers to the Applicant, Retailer, and Dealer. They have access to the portal where they can submit applications, redeem vouchers, and perform other necessary actions related to their roles. Here's a summarized flow of actions: Applicant: Applies for the program via the portal. CRM Admin/User: Reviews and approves/rejects the application in the CRM. Applicant: Receives notification regarding the status of their application (approved/rejected). Retailer/Dealer: Redeems the voucher by submitting a request/response through the portal. Admin: Reviews the redemption request/response. If Approved: For E-bike vouchers: Retailer confirms the redemption, and the applicant gets their E-bike. For VXC vouchers: A new voucher is generated for the dealer, and redemption occurs for the specific voucher. This process ensures that applicants, retailers, and dealers can interact with the program through the portal, while admins manage the configuration and approval processes through the CRM. User Story:\n4.1 Scenario: Rebate Redemption Return Process through 'Return for edits' option\n4.2 General Pre condition: \n4.2.1 Conditions under which a voucher redemption can be \"Cancelled\":\na. Voucher Redeemed AND\nb. Voucher Redemption is submitted AND\nc. Payment is created\n4.3 Pre condition specific to 'Return for edits' option:\na. If the CRM user selects, \"Return for edits\" , a dialog box opens to capture the return reason, once reason is entered, user clicks on \"Ok\"\n4.4 Input parameters and expected results:\n4.4.1 Payment:\na. IF payment is in \"New\" or \"Draft\"- update the payment status to \"Cancel\" and no further action required\nb. IF payment is in \u201cApproved\u201d- Remove from related TAR. Payment status updates to \u201cCancelled\u201d\nc. IF payment is in \u201cIn Progress\u201d or \u201cCompleted\u201d \u2013 create a payment in the negative for the same account. DO NOT UPDATE STATUS TO CANCELLED\n4.4.2 Voucher Redemption:\na. Voucher Redemption status updates to \" Returned\"- Restriction: Only when the Voucher redemption is in the \"Submitted\" state\n\u2022 Create a new status of \"Returned\" for Voucher Redemption\n4.4.3 Voucher:\na. No change to the voucher status;\nb. No change to Dealer Response and Dealer's voucher status\n4.4.4 System sends notification to Vendor with Reason for Return (Need verbiage) Few Shots about Assumptions:\nPayment staus 'New' and 'Draft' are same. So, there is no need for individual testcase for each of these.\nPayment staus 'In Progress' and 'Completed' are different\nIf the criteria mentioned for Input Parameters look like contradicting to those in Pre condition, please relate both of them and come to a wise conclusion\nAssume Voucher and Voucher Redemption are separate entities",
        "response": "## Test Scenario Assumptions for User Story 4.1: Rebate Redemption Return Process \n\n**1. Payment Status Equivalence:** \n* Assumption: The payment statuses \"New\" and \"Draft\" are functionally equivalent, meaning a single test case covering one status can encompass both.\n\n**2. Payment Status Logic:**\n* Assumption: While the user story mentions payment statuses \"In Progress\" and \"Completed\", it's unclear if they are mutually exclusive or if a payment can transition between these states.\n* Decision: Assume \"In Progress\" and \"Completed\" are distinct states, requiring separate test cases for each.\n\n**3. Voucher Redemption Status:**\n* Assumption: The user story states that Voucher Redemption status can be \"Submitted\" or \"Returned\", implying that these are the only two possible states.\n* Decision: Assume that no other states for Voucher Redemption exist.\n\n**4. Voucher Redemption and Voucher Relationship:** \n* Assumption: The user story does not specify a relationship between Voucher Redemption and Voucher.\n* Decision: Assume that Voucher and Voucher Redemption are distinct entities with their own unique statuses, even if they are linked.\n\n**5. System Notification:** \n* Assumption: The user story mentions a notification to the vendor, but doesn't provide details on the notification's format or content.\n* Decision: Assume the notification is an email with a standard template, including the reason for return provided by the CRM user.\n\n**6. \"Return for Edits\" Option:**\n* Assumption: The user story implies that the \"Return for Edits\" option is available regardless of the current status of the Voucher Redemption.\n* Decision: Assume that \"Return for Edits\" can be selected at any time during the Voucher Redemption process.\n\n**7. CRM User Role:**\n* Assumption: The user story mentions a CRM user selecting the \"Return for Edits\" option, but does not specify if this is a general CRM user or a specific role with certain permissions.\n* Decision: Assume the CRM user role is a general user with access to the \"Return for Edits\" option.\n\n**8. Voucher Redemption Status Transition:**\n* Assumption: The user story mentions a new status \"Returned\" for Voucher Redemption, but doesn't explicitly define its relation to the existing \"Submitted\" state.\n* Decision: Assume that the \"Returned\" status is a distinct state reached from the \"Submitted\" state and cannot directly transition back to \"Submitted\". \n\n**9. \"Return for Edits\" Dialogue Box:**\n* Assumption: The user story mentions a dialogue box for entering the return reason, but doesn't specify if it is mandatory or optional to provide a reason.\n* Decision: Assume providing a reason is mandatory for selecting \"Return for Edits\". \n\nThese assumptions are based on the provided user story and are meant to guide the test scenario development. It's important to communicate these assumptions to the developers to ensure that the test cases accurately reflect the expected behavior of the application. \n",
